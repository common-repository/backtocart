== Description ==

Backtocart WordPress is a Software as a Service one-off plugin. It's main function, limited to this version, is to automatically install the embed (tracking) code in the <head> section of your WordPress website for our lightboxes to show up and for you to be able to track the actions of your visitors and make more informed decisions.

Our services simplify the process of connecting various eCommerce platforms (WooCommerce, PrestaShop, Shopify, etc.) to your website through our "Integrations" feature. This feature will be coming up in later updates and will be an important addition to our service.

* Track the records of your every user's abandoned cart (like total $ value of the abandoned cart, email, user name, abandonment date)

* New features will be added to Backtocart WordPress in the upcoming versions
